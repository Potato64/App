# App
These are the files for the MPos Sound Board. This app is designed to play sounds from MPos (some person that I know).
If you do not know MPos, this may not make much sense. It may not make sense anyway. It is still a work in progress,
so there are still some bugs and problems, and there are several features that still need to be implemented.
I am planning to produce some updates for it in the future.
